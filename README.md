# Film-Finder
Film Finder from Codecademy
In this project, i’ll use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. 
How to use App: Before you begin, you’ll need to create an account on The Movie Database website. After you create your account and verify your email address, click on your user icon at the top right corner and navigate to the Settings page.On the Settings page, navigate to the API section and click on the link to Request an API Key to register as a Developer.You’ll be asked to enter some personal information like your address and phone number. This is pretty common. Many APIs use this information to keep track of how their data is being used.
